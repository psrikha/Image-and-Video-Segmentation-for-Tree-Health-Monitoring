# Image-and-Video-Segmentation-for-Tree-Health-Monitoring

Implemented machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Python, to classify trees as healthy or unhealthy from image and video sources. 
This project aims to automate the classification process using advanced image processing techniques and deep learning models.
